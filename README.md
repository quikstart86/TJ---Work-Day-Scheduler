# TJ---Work-Day-Scheduler

## [Description](#description)

This challenge required us to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by Bootstrap, jQuery and Dayjs plugin.

## [Acceptance Criteria](#acceptance-criteria)

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a simple day calendar scheduler that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

* Display the current day at the top of the calender when a user opens the planner.
* Present time blocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.
* Color-code each time block based on past, present, and future when the time block is viewed.
* Allow a user to enter an event when they click a time block
* Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that time block.
* Persist events between refreshes of a page

## [Installation](#installation)

I started by creating a new repo on GitHub giving it a unique name and then cloning it to my local environment using GitBash. I then created several files including one for HTML/CSS/JS and an assets folder. I created an index.html / script.js / style.css file in gitbash using 'touch' and then began to work through the files. Coding in HTML first to create the structure, and then once sufficiently built out, I proceeded to work on the JavaScript and CSS. With any new major features/changes to the the code I added (git add -A) the changes, committed the changes (git commit -m " ") and then pushed them up to my remote repo on GitHub (git push origin).
